ECED3401 Systems Analysis
Lunar Ice Cave Explorer (LICE) Project
Current Stage: Task 5

Authors:

Overview:

This program is part of the larger Lunar Ice Cave Explorer (LICE) project, which aims to design software
for the Canadian Space Agency's LICER rover. The LICER will autonomously explore lunar caves, map them,
and search for ice. 

This implementation at its current stage specifically addresses Task 5, which focuses on creating a
cave mapping tool. The maps generated here will later be used by the LICER to navigate and find ice 
(in Task 7) as well as stored for future retrieval (Task 6).
